## Google Load Balancing

Google Cloud Load Balancing is a high performance, scalable load
balancing, which has state of the art auto scaling feature which
distributes traffic intelligetly such that application still have
resources in spite of huge increase in traffic and it does not require
pre-warming, as it quickly reaches from zero to
full-throttle@hid-sp18-602-www-loadbalancing-main. Google Load balancing
support different flavors such as HTTP,TCP/SSL and UDP Load
Balancing@hid-sp18-602-www-loadbalancing-main. Also the new UI enables
users to integrate any of these flavors easily through a single
interface.

Apart from that Google cloud load balancing promotes state-of-the art auto scaling and load balancing features, for instance it provides global load balancing with single any cast IP. This feature helps over one million queries per second, along with high performance and low latency@hid-sp18-602-www-loadbalancing-main. Traffic centers distributed globally maximizes the distance traveled on googleâ€™s fast private network.
 
As mentioned above, cloud load balancer can efficiently scale as traffic grows day by day and has capability of handling unexpected spikes and huge volumes , it can divert traffic across the globe in matter of seconds to keep up the speed.If backend becomes unhealthy or any issue occurs, it is even capable of gently moving the traffic from current region to another with ease due to the flexibility of cross region load balancing@hid-sp18-602-www-loadbalancing-main. As opposed to DNS based balancing solution the cloud based load balancing reacts instantaneously with any change in users, traffic, other conditions in fraction of seconds.

Backend services are resources with configuration values for different load balancing services such as TCP Proxy Load balancing, SSL Proxy load balancing etc@hid-sp18-602-www-loadbalancing-backend-service. Depending on the type of the load balancer deployments can have single or multiple backend services. It depends on the developer requirements, design architecture and some other factors taken into consideration are capacity setting, balancing mode, regional instance groups, zonal instance groups, session affinity and network endpoints etchid-sp18-602-www-google-loadbalancing-choose.
