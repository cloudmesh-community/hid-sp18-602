## Cloud AutoML

Cloud AutoML is an innovative tool with simple graphical user interface
to train and test users custom machine learning
models @hid-sp18-602-www-cloudautoml-main. And these models can be
directly used from Google cloud via REST API.

The main purpose of developing Cloud AutoML is to enable users with
limited machine learning expertise to train high quality ML models. It
is built on Google learning to learn, transfer learning, and Neural
Architecture Search technologies.

Google has launched series of products under Cloud AutoML and AutoML
Vision is the first one which gathered attraction from lot of rising tech companies. This service mainly gives access to a pre-trained model or create a custom ML models using Cloud ML Engine, for image recognition. It offers
drag-and-drop interface to upload images, train and manage models, and
then deploy those trained models directly on Google Cloud. For instance,
Disney and Zoological Society of London are actively using AutoML
Vision @hid-sp18-602-wwww-cloudautoml-blog. Similarly, the next popular product is CloudAutoML for Natural Language Processing, Translation and so on.

A Beta version of Cloud AutoML has recently been made availble for public access which leverages more usage even by individuals who might not be ML Experts to build custom ML models that works efficiently for their preferred dataset. Apart from that Google makes usage of these products more accessible through REST API's that can be easily integrated and scaled across your projects@hid-sp18-602-wwww-cloudautoml-blog.
